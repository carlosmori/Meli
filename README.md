Simple Node JS - React App. In this particular App I wanted to try integrating JWT and using an ORM for the first time.

[Github -> CharlyÂ´s Restaurant (WIP)](https://github.com/carlosmori/Restaurant)
This is my working project, please take into account that the react part is the core here, the API is poorly implemented because I am leaving that for the end. I wanted to design a software for a fictitious Restaurant using the latest tools.

React: Redux Sagas for state management with Ducks arquitecure, React Material for the UI,   
Node JS: Express, Sequelize (poorly implemented api, still work in progress please take that into account)
